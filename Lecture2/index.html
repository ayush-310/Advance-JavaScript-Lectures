    <h2>#2 Advance JavaScript Let Const Variables </h2>

    <h4>Var</h4>
    <p>This keyword is used to declare variable globally. If you used this keyword to declare variable then the variable
        can accessible globally and changeable also.

    <h4>let</h4>
    <p>This keyword is used to declare variable locally. If you used this keyword to declare variable then the variable
        can accessible locally and it is changeable as well. It is good if the code gets huge.</p>


    <h4>const</h4>
    <p>This keyword is used to declare variable locally. If you use this keyword to declare a variable then the variable
        will only accessible within that block simiar to the variable defined by using let and difference between let
        and const is that the variables declared using const values can't be reassigned. So we should assign the value
        while declaring the variable.</p>
